# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SolarConnect platform currently has a critical security vulnerability where password authentication is not properly implemented. The system accepts any password for demo purposes, which poses significant security risks for production deployment. This feature will implement a comprehensive, secure authentication and password management system that follows industry best practices for password security, user registration, and account management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account with a secure password, so that I can access the platform safely and protect my personal information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL display a registration form with email, password, and password confirmation fields
2. WHEN a user enters a password THEN the system SHALL validate it meets security requirements (minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
3. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL hash the password using bcrypt with salt rounds of 12 or higher
4. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account and send an email verification link
5. WHEN a user tries to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
6. WHEN password and password confirmation don't match THEN the system SHALL display a validation error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want to log in with my email and password, so that I can access my account securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL verify the password against the stored hash using bcrypt
2. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display a generic error message without revealing whether email or password was incorrect
3. WHEN a user fails login attempts 5 times within 15 minutes THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 30 minutes
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure session and redirect to appropriate dashboard
5. WHEN a user's email is not verified THEN the system SHALL prevent login and prompt for email verification
6. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL log the login event with timestamp and IP address

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it, so that I can regain access to my account securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" THEN the system SHALL display a password reset request form
2. WHEN a user enters their email for password reset THEN the system SHALL send a secure reset token via email (if email exists)
3. WHEN a user clicks a valid reset link THEN the system SHALL display a new password form with the same validation rules as registration
4. WHEN a user submits a new password via reset link THEN the system SHALL hash and update the password and invalidate the reset token
5. WHEN a reset token is older than 1 hour THEN the system SHALL reject it as expired
6. WHEN a reset token has been used THEN the system SHALL invalidate it to prevent reuse

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to change my password, so that I can maintain account security and update my credentials when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses password change settings THEN the system SHALL require current password verification
2. WHEN a user enters their current password incorrectly THEN the system SHALL display an error and not allow password change
3. WHEN a user enters a valid current password and new password THEN the system SHALL hash and update the password
4. WHEN a user successfully changes password THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing sessions except the current one
5. WHEN a user changes password THEN the system SHALL send a notification email about the password change
6. WHEN a user changes password THEN the system SHALL log the password change event

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my account to be verified via email, so that the platform can ensure account authenticity and enable secure communications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL generate a unique email verification token
2. WHEN a user clicks the verification link THEN the system SHALL mark the email as verified and enable full account access
3. WHEN a verification token is older than 24 hours THEN the system SHALL reject it as expired
4. WHEN a user tries to access protected features with unverified email THEN the system SHALL redirect to email verification prompt
5. WHEN a user requests a new verification email THEN the system SHALL generate a new token and invalidate the old one
6. WHEN a user's email is successfully verified THEN the system SHALL log the verification event

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor authentication events and security incidents, so that I can maintain platform security and respond to threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any authentication event occurs THEN the system SHALL log it with timestamp, IP address, user agent, and outcome
2. WHEN suspicious login patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them for admin review
3. WHEN an account is locked due to failed attempts THEN the system SHALL notify administrators
4. WHEN a user changes critical account information THEN the system SHALL log the change with before/after values
5. WHEN administrators access security logs THEN the system SHALL display them in a searchable, filterable interface
6. WHEN security events exceed normal thresholds THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication system to be resilient against common attacks, so that user accounts and platform data remain secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes authentication requests THEN it SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
2. WHEN the system stores passwords THEN it SHALL use bcrypt with a minimum of 12 salt rounds
3. WHEN the system generates tokens THEN it SHALL use cryptographically secure random generation
4. WHEN the system handles authentication errors THEN it SHALL not reveal information that could aid attackers
5. WHEN the system processes login attempts THEN it SHALL implement timing attack protection
6. WHEN the system detects potential security threats THEN it SHALL implement appropriate defensive m
