## Running Security Tests

### Run All Security Tests
```bash
npm run test:security
```

### Run Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Attack vector tests
npm test -- __tests__/security/attack-vector-tests.test.ts

# Brute force simulation
npm test -- __tests__/security/brute-force-simulation.test.ts

# Timing attack resistance
npm test -- __tests__/security/timing-attack-resistance.test.ts

# Penetration testing
npm test -- __tests__/security/penetration-testing.test.ts
```

### Run Security Test Runner
```bash
npx ts-node __tests__/security/security-test-runner.ts
```

## Security Test Reports

The security test runner generates comprehensive reports:

### Report Location
- **JSON Report**: `security-reports/security-report-[timestamp].json`
- **Markdown Summary**: `security-reports/latest-security-summary.md`

### Report Contents
- Overall security score (0-100)
- Test results breakdown
- Critical findings
- Security recommendations
- Test suite performance metrics

## Security Score Interpretation

- **90-100**: Excellent security posture
- **80-89**: Good security posture, minor improvements needed
- **70-79**: Acceptable security posture, some concerns to address
- **Below 70**: Critical security attention required

## Test Categories and Requirements Mapping

### Requirement 7.1 - Attack Resilience
- **Tests**: All attack vector tests, brute force simulation
- **Validates**: Rate limiting, input validation, attack detection

### Requirement 7.4 - Information Security
- **Tests**: Timing attack resistance, information disclosure tests
- **Validates**: Consistent response times, no information leakage

### Requirement 7.5 - Defensive Mechanisms
- **Tests**: Penetration testing, comprehensive security assessment
- **Validates**: Overall security posture, defense in depth

## Attack Scenarios Tested

### SQL Injection

- Union-based attacks
- Blind SQL injection
- Time-based SQL injection

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Reflected XSS
- Stored XSS
- DOM-based XSS
- Filter bypass techniques

### Brute Force Attacks
- Dictionary attacks
- Credential stuffing
- Password spraying
- Distributed attacks
- Account lockout bypass

### Timing Attacks
- User enumeration via timing
- Password validation timing
- Token validation timing
- Database query timing

### Advanced Attacks
- Session fixation
- Mass assignment
- Header injection
- Path traversal
- Command injection

## Security Testing Best Practices

### Test Environment
- Use isolated test environment
- Mock external dependencies
- Simulate realistic attack conditions
- Test under load conditions

### Test Data
- Use realistic attack payloads
- Test with various input sizes
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test with malformed data

### Reporting
- Document all findings
- Provide remediation recommendations
- Track security metrics over time
- Generate executive summaries

## Continuous Security Testing

### Integration with CI/CD
Add security tests to your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Security Tests
  run: |
    npm run test:security
    npx ts-node __tests__/security/security-test-runner.ts
```

### Regular Security Assessment
- Run security tests before each release
- Perform monthly comprehensive security assessments
- Update attack vectors based on threat intelligence
- Review and update security thresholds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Timeouts
- Increase Jest timeout for timing tests
- Optimize test data size for performance tests

#### Mock Configuration
- Ensure all external dependencies are properly mocked
- Verify database and Redis mocks are configured correctly

#### Rate Limiting Tests
- Adjust rate limiting thresholds for test environment
- Ensure Redis mock properly simulates rate limiting behavior

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging for detailed test execution information:

```bash
DEBUG=security-tests npm test -- __tests__/security/
```

## Contributing

### Adding New Security Tests
1. Follow existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Map tests to specific security requirements
4. Update configuration files as needed
5. Add tests to the security test runner

### Updating Attack Vectors
1. Research current threat landscape
2. Update `security-test-config.ts` with new payloads
3. Add corresponding test cases
4. Document new attack scenarios

## Security Considerations

### Test Data Security
- Never use real credentials in tests
- Use mock data that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Sanitize test outputs and logs

### Test Environment Isolation
- Run security tests in isolated environments
- Prevent test attacks from affecting production systems
- Use dedicated test databases and services

### Responsible Disclosure
- Report any real vulnerabilities found during testing
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Document and track all security findings
