## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Step 1: Prepare Environment
```bash
# Copy and configure environment file
cp .env.example .env.production

# Edit .env.production with production values
nano .env.production
```

### Step 2: Database Setup
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Push schema to production database
npx prisma db push

# Seed with initial data (optional)
npm run db:seed
```

### Step 3: Deploy Application

**Option A: Docker Deployment**
```bash
# Make deployment script executable (Linux/Mac)
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh

# Run deployment script
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Or on Windows
scripts\deploy.bat
```

**Option B: Vercel Deployment**
1. Connect repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy automatically

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Check application health
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health

# Verify database connection
docker-compose exec next-app npx prisma studio

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f next-app
```
